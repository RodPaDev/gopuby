****# GoPuby - Terminal EPUB Reader

### Description
GoPuby is a terminal-based EPUB reader designed to allow users to read and interact with EPUB files directly in their terminal. The application supports text and image rendering and provides a seamless, scroll-based reading experience. It is built with Go.

## Installation

To install GoPuby, you will need to have Go installed on your machine. You can download and install Go from the official website: https://golang.org/dl/

Once you have Go installed, you can install GoPuby by running the following command:

```bash
go get github.com/rodpadev/gopuby
```

This will download and install the GoPuby package and its dependencies.

## Usage

To use GoPuby, you can run the following command:

```bash
gopuby
```
You will be prompted to enter the path to the EPUB file you want to read. Once you enter the path, GoPuby will load the EPUB file and display the text content in your terminal.


Alternatively, you can specify the path to the EPUB file directly in the command line:
```bash
gopuby <path-to-epub-file>
```

## What's Next?
A lot more features are planned you can look at the [todo.md](todo.md) file for more information.
I have learned a lot form this project, the main focus was to write another project in Golang and I have achieved that. 

I still want this to be feature complete and I will come back to it at some point (or not) and finish it.
